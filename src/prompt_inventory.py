You are an expert in crime analysis and prediction. Your task is to analyze crime data and exogenous information to predict crime amount on given location and date. You will be given meta info about the target city and area's latitude and longitude within given city, a time series of historical crime amount, a summary from event-level crime record, and you will use them to help you make the prediction.

[Meta Information]
The city you will work around it Dallas, TX. Dallas County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, the population was 2,613,539, and was estimated to be 2,656,028 in 2024, making it the second-most populous county in Texas and the eighth-most populous county in the United States.

Dallas County is included in the eleven-county Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metropolitan statistical area, which is the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the United States. Municipal expansion within Dallas County has blurred the geographic lines between cities and between neighboring counties.

The target predicting area with 0.05X0.05 square is {longitude}, {latitude}, in past years, the crime amount is {last_year_sum}, the prediction date is {prediction_date}.

[Prediction Information]
The daily crime amount in past 14 days from further to closer is {past_14_days_crime_time_series}, the cycle of one month ago, three month ago, six month ago, one year ago and two years ago are {cycle_data_points}.

Summary of event-level crime records in past 14 days is {event_level_crime_summary}.

The whether of the target area on the prediction date is {weather_information}.

[Task]
With all above information your task is to predict the crime amount in the target area on the prediction date in format of a integer. Do not output any other information, just the integer number of predicted crime amount of prediction date on given area.
